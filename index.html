            <h5><b>Born:</b> June8, 1955, <a href="http://">London, England</a>(age 68)</h5>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee (born June 8, 1955, London, England) is a British computer scientist, generally credited
                as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004, he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the
                United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish Technology
                Award Foundation.

                Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first
                commercial computer. (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from
                the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey
                Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in
                the computer industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant
                at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.</p>
